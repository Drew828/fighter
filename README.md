# Making a Teakwondo simulation
    Kicks+Punches count for different amounts
        Punches are 5pt(punc)
            Costs 10 energy
        Kicks are 10pt(kic)
            Costs 20 energy
        Spinning kicks are 20pts(spk)
            Costs 30 energy
        Block are 0pts (blk) Blocks have a 50% chance of stopping the attack at base level
            Costs 5 energy
    Player will start with 5 hearts(hrt) these will decrease and incerease through out the match(mtc)
    Player has 5 hearts each heart is equal to 20pts(pts)
    Match runs in seconds(sec)
        Every 5 seconds you gain 20pts or 1 heart
    Energy(eng)
        Getting hit removes 40 out of 100 damage 
        Player passively gains 10 energy per second
        If the player reaches 0 energy they will lose half a heart every second
    Match runs until one player no longer has 5 hearts
    Upgades(upg) will be used with upgrade tokens these will allow you to increase your stats. Using one upgrade token you can upgrade:
        Offence: This makes each punch/kick deal 2 more pts
        Defence: This makes your blocks 5% more lickely to block an attack
        Health: This add 10 more health or half a heart ppl[]
